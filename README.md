- 👋 Hi, I’m @najevi
- 👀 I’m interested in ... let me c ... cooking, coding, communication (languages), cruising (overseas travel), chilling (reading, tinkering, gardening, etc.), cycling and catamarans.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and specifically the boardgame.io library which entails learning about node.js and react.js
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a taylor-able React.js app that will allow 2 to ~7 users to play online the board game Risk, taylored to any one of the now numerous themed-variations. (While giving IP/copyright owners due respect!)
- 📫 How to reach me ...
